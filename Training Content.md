### **Level 1 – Child**

> Private banking is like having your own money helper at a bank. Instead of waiting in line, you get someone who helps you manage your money, save for big things, and sometimes even grow your money by making smart choices.
> 

---

### **Level 2 – High School Student**

> Private banking is a special service banks offer to people who have a lot of money. Instead of just a regular account, they get a personal banker who helps them plan for things like buying property, investing, paying less tax legally, or even passing money to their kids one day. It’s like VIP treatment for your money.
> 

---

### **Level 3 – Entry-Level Finance**

> Private banking refers to personalised financial services provided by banks to high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs). These services include investment advice, wealth management, estate planning, tax optimisation, credit facilities, and more. Clients typically have dedicated relationship managers who provide tailored solutions based on their financial goals and risk appetite. The aim is to preserve and grow wealth while offering privacy and exclusivity.
> 

---

### **Level 4 – Professional in Finance**

> Private banking is a suite of bespoke financial services targeted at affluent clients, typically those with investable assets over a certain threshold (e.g., $1 million+). It encompasses discretionary portfolio management, structured products, estate planning, trust services, and bespoke credit solutions. Relationship managers act as conduits to the bank's broader capabilities, often supported by investment advisors, tax specialists, and legal experts. The value proposition is built on confidentiality, customisation, and privileged access to institutional-grade opportunities.

    - A **discretionary portfolio** (e.g., 40% equities, 30% fixed income, 15% private equity, 15% cash)
    - Access to **alternative funds** and **pre-IPO** opportunities not available to retail investors

---

### **Example 2: Credit Solution**

**Client:** Real estate developer needing short-term liquidity for a new project

**Bank Action:**

### **Level 5 – Expert / Wealth Management Strategist**

> Private banking is an integrated, relationship-led wealth management model serving ultra- and high-net-worth individuals, often through a combination of discretionary and advisory mandates. It functions within a fiduciary framework, optimizing asset allocation across geographies, tax jurisdictions, and risk-adjusted vehicles, including alternative investments (PE, VC, real estate), bespoke lending (securities-based lending, art finance), and intergenerational wealth transfer structures. It also increasingly intersects with family office services, behavioral finance, and regulatory complexity (e.g., CRS, FATCA), demanding a nuanced, multi-disciplinary approach to holistic financial stewardship.
> 

At this level, private banking evolves into **holistic wealth architecture**. It is tailored for **ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs)**, families, and **family offices**, typically with **$20M–$500M+** in assets.

It integrates **portfolio theory**, **global tax optimization**, **philanthropy**, and **succession planning** across **multiple generations and jurisdictions**.
